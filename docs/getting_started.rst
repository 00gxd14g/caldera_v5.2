**CALDERA** is an automated cyber adversary emulation system.
**CALDERA** can be used to simulate the post compromise behavior of a cyber adversary on a Windows
Enterpise network.

If you want to dive right in, start with the :doc:`requirements` and then read :doc:`installation`.

If building a custom test environment for CALDERA, read :doc:`environment_setup` to see how to set up a network for
**CALDERA** to run in.

After installing **CALDERA**, read :doc:`first_operation` to see how to run your first Adversary Emulation
operation.

We also recommend taking a look at :doc:`philosophy` to understand why **CALDERA** was designed.

If you run into trouble, :doc:`configuration` may have settings that you need to tweak to get **CALDERA** to work
in your environment.

If interested in the internal workings of **CALDERA** see the :doc:`logic` and :doc:`developer`.

And finally, for information on how to add new adversary techniques to **CALDERA**, read :doc:`add_technique`.
